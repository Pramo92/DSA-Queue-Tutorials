# DSA-Queue-Tutorials
Write a program which prints given string as it is using queues.
2. Write a program which appends two given strings such that the second string is appended to the end of the first string using a queue.
Input: 
string1 : Hello
string2 : World
Output: HelloWorld
3. Write a function that will read one line of input from the terminal. The input is supposed to consist of two separated by a colon (:). As its result, your function should proceed a single character as follows. 
• N: No colon in the line
• L: The left part is longer than the right
• R: The right part is longer than the left
• D: The right and left parts have the same length but different
• S: The right and left parts are exactly the same
Example: 
 Input Output 
Sample Sample N 
Short : Long L 
Sample : Sample S 
Write a code for the above scenario using queues.
4. Write a program to change the first half of a number with its second half using queue operations.

5. Write a program that reads a string that the user provides and prints the vowels in the string in ascending order of the alphabet using a queue. 
Input Output
ALGORITHMS A O I
6. Rearrange the elements of an even-length queue of integers by interleaving the first and second half of the queue.
Input: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
Output: 10 60 20 70 30 80 40 90 50 100
7. Student in a class have marks of 3 subjects Mathematics, chemistry, and physics. For each student in the class should calculate the total & the average marks. Using Queue, write a C program to read the marks and print only the average marks of each student in order of data inserted. (Hint: You should define a suitable user-defined data type to keep student number, marks of 3 subjects, total and average mark
